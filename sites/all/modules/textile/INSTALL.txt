For a new installation, copy the entire textile module directory to the
appropriate module directory within your Drupal installation.

Then download the most up to date textile library from thresholdstate:

http://textile.thresholdstate.com/

The library should be availble via a link on the right in tar.gz or zip
formats. Uncompress the download, and place the classTextile.php file
into the same directory as textile.module.

You can also get the library from their SVN reposiory:

http://textpattern.googlecode.com/svn/releases/4.0/source/textpattern/lib/classTextile.php

Then log into your site, enable the Textile module on the
admin/build/modules page. Finally, you must add the Textile filter to
the appropriate input formats and set any desired configuration options.

NOTE: you need to be careful with how your input filters are ordered. I
recommend setting up a special filter for textile. Disable the
line-break converter, and set up the HTML filter to run AFTER textile,
and only allow the types of tags you want to permit.
